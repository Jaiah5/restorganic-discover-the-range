Restorganic Discover The Range Campaign

Take a look at the email I built using HTML, CSS, and VML mark up language for creating ghost tables for the Discover the range email campaign for Restorganic. The campaign aims to showcase the different pillows within the Restorganic organic latex pillow collection to increase awareness and encourage purchase.

This email template is optimised for Dark mode/Gmail Dark mode, mobile, and Outlook.
